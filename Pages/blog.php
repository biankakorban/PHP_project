                            <p>Power prices are in the news, prompting some households to take a fresh look at energy consumption. 
                                The good news is there's plenty you can do to lower your bills by changing how and when you use energy, 
                                nd by shopping around for an energy contract which suits your needs.</p>
                            <p>Every household situation is different and the changes for each household will be different. The best place to start is by understanding how much energy you use each day (and when), as well as which energy saving actions will have the biggest impact in your home.

                            <p class="card-text">Electricity and gas make up a big slice of the household budget, so it pays – or more to the point, saves – to use energy wisely. 
                                There are some very simple ways to save money on energy bills, and there are even more savings if you dig a bit deeper.</p>
                            <p>For example, washing clothes in cold rather than hot water could save you about $124 a year according to 
                                the Australian Department of Industry and Science.</p>
                            <p>Drying laundry on a clothesline once a week instead of in a dryer could save you about $70 annually,
                                and turning games consoles off rather than switching to standby could save up to $169.</p>

                                Earlier this month, data from Carbon + Energy Markets (CME) MarkIntell found Australian residential 
                                customers were paying the highest electricity prices in the world.<br><br>
                                And if you're living in South Australia, you're likely paying more for power than the rest of the country.
